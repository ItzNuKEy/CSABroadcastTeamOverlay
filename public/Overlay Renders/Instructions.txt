Hey there! Since this setup is still rudemenatary and hasn't been super streamlined into an application yet, and you are reading this, then....

LUCKY YOU! You are getting to use this BETA!

Instructions Follow:

1. Launch the app by opening any terminal within the directory of dy-overlay-rl. 
(If not in VSCode, simply open the dy-overlay-folder, head up to your file explorer directory {Looks like a search bar.} and type in CMD)
2. You should then be able to enter "npm start". This will start the overlay app.
3. Check the local host it launches on, this will most likely be "http://localhost:5173" but could be different.
4. Launch OBS.
5. Create the same amount of scenes that you would need per overlay render. (Ex. Game Overlay {Overlay.html}; EndGameStats {EndGameStats.html})
6. Create a browser source in each scene, the viewport height & width should be, 1920x1080. (You cannot reuse the same browser source you need to make new ones each scene.)
7. Copy the local host link, and paste it in each browser source, at the end add a "/" and then add the following:
        ( Will be updated depending on current Overlay Renders Available )
    - Overlay.html
    - EndGameStats.html 
8. Make sure you have Rocket League and Bakkesmod launched with the SOS.dll plugin installed.
